//! Goldfish mulligan modes.
//!
//! Three pluggable opening-hand policies for the cast-Doomsday-ASAP pilot, so the
//! goldfish can show a deck under different mulligan disciplines (the headline
//! P(cast by cutoff) shifts a lot with how hard you mulligan):
//!
//! - [`MullMode::Keep7`] — never mulligan. Pure raw deck speed, no mulligan dynamics.
//! - [`MullMode::Realistic`] — a *player's-thought-process* heuristic: keep a hand
//!   with real mana and an actual plan to cast Doomsday; mulligan no-mana / flooded /
//!   do-nothing hands. Built and validated card-by-card against human judgement (see
//!   the `sample_hands` example). It deliberately does NOT consult `p_cast_by` — every
//!   keep/mull names an inspectable reason.
//! - [`MullMode::Aggressive`] — the fanatical race bar: keep only a guaranteed-or-nearly
//!   guaranteed fast Doomsday — a DETERMINISTIC line by the cutoff, or Doomsday + BB +
//!   a castable cantrip to dig the last black. No `p_cast_by`; speculative cantrip hands
//!   are thrown back, so it rewards decks with more fast enablers (rituals/petals/tutors).
//!
//! The `Realistic` rule is the load-bearing one. Its logic (the "G1 / blind" checklist):
//!
//! ```text
//! KEEP if any fires (the solver does the deterministic checks; heuristics do the rest):
//!   - at 4 cards (mulligans_taken >= 3);
//!   - a DETERMINISTIC Doomsday line by the cutoff   (this is "DD + a way to reach BBB");
//!   - Tamiyo plan:  Tamiyo + a blue land to cast it + (a look or a fetch to fuel);
//!   - combo-in-progress:  Doomsday in hand + a black source + a castable look;
//!   - dig:  two castable looks.
//! else MULL — i.e. no colored land, flooded (>= 4 lands), or just sources + filler.
//! ```
//!
//! A "look" is a card-selection effect you can actually pay for: a cast-to-dig cantrip
//! (Ponder/Brainstorm/Consider — needs blue) or a free cycling cantrip (Street Wraith —
//! always castable). Sources are counted the way the *game* sees them: only
//! unconditional colored lands are a mana base (Cavern of Souls, colored only for
//! creatures, and one-shots like Lotus Petal are not).
